## 💡 Pro Tips

### For Technical Interviews
1. **Always explain WHY**: Don't just say "I used ControlNet." Say "I used ControlNet because it preserves structure via zero convolutions without disrupting pre-trained weights."

2. **Use numbers**: "15-second inference" sounds better than "fast." Memorize: 15s, 95%, 7GB, 1.4B, 512-dim.

3. **Show trade-off awareness**: "I chose float16 for 2× speedup, accepting 0.1% quality loss."

4. **Draw diagrams**: If remote, share screen and use drawing tool. If in-person, use whiteboard liberally.

5. **Admit unknowns**: "I haven't implemented that yet, but here's how I would..." sounds better than making things up.

### For Behavioral Interviews
1. **Have a story**: "The hardest problem was extending LangChain for multimodal embeddings. Here's how I debugged it..."

2. **Show ownership**: Use "I" not "we" (even if team project). Take credit for your contributions.

3. **Discuss failures**: "Initially I tried X but it failed because Y. I learned Z."

4. **Connect to company**: "This project uses [their tech stack]. I'm excited to apply these skills at [company]."

### For System Design Interviews
1. **Start with requirements**: "Are we optimizing for latency, cost, or quality?"

2. **Consider scale**: "This works for 10 users. At 1000 users, we'd need..."

3. **Propose alternatives**: "We could use ChromaDB or Pinecone. ChromaDB is faster for small datasets..."

4. **Discuss monitoring**: "I'd track GPU utilization, latency percentiles, and error rates."

## 🎯 Key Talking Points (Memorize These)

### 1. Project in One Sentence
> "A RAG-powered image generation system that decouples style from structure using ControlNet for geometry and IP-Adapter for style, achieving 15-second inference with 95% structural accuracy."

### 2. Main Innovation
> "Hybrid control mechanism combining spatial conditioning (ControlNet), style injection (IP-Adapter), and semantic retrieval (RAG) - a novel combination not available in any single model."

### 3. Technical Depth
> "I extended LangChain's Embeddings interface for multimodal support, optimized GPU memory through mixed precision and attention slicing, and architected for horizontal scaling."

### 4. Results
> "Achieved 15-second generation (5× faster than baseline), 95% structure preservation, 85% style consistency, at $0.02 per generation."

### 5. Production Thinking
> "Designed with microservices architecture, API-first approach, and modular components. Moving to production is infrastructure, not rewriting code."

## 🚫 Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### Don't Say:
❌ "I just used pre-trained models"  
✅ "I integrated and optimized three models with custom conditioning"

❌ "It's basically RAG with images"  
✅ "I extended text RAG to multimodal with custom CLIP embeddings"

❌ "I followed a tutorial"  
✅ "I researched state-of-art techniques and combined them uniquely"

❌ "It works on my machine"  
✅ "I designed for production with scaling, monitoring, and security in mind"

❌ "I don't know the math"  
✅ "The diffusion process uses denoising: x_{t-1} = (x_t - ε) / √α"
